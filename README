[The original README has moved to doc/INTERNALS.]

Xpost3 is undergoing rapid changes in the direction of portability
under the skillful care and guidance of contributor Vincent Torri.

Xpost3 is currently (10/15/2013, and in the author's opinion) a
pretty-solid cross-platform scripting-language interpreter.

But it does not currently have any graphical output capability. :(
		We're working on it. :)


Quick Installation Instructions.
----- ------------ -------------

Currently the intepreter source is in src/bin and the commands
  ./autogen.sh (or ./configure if autogen.sh has already been launched)
  make
will create the interpreter binary itp(.exe)? in src/bin.
  make install
will install the application, so itp can be run as a command.

Xpost also has the ability to determine if it is being run from the
real installation directory or just being from the source directory.
So you can also do a "quick-install" just to try it out by creating
an alias in the shell (which will of course only be valid for the
current shell and will disappear when the shell is terminated).
  alias itp="$PWD/src/bin/itp"
will create a temporary shell alias for the current session.


Many more installation and configuration options desribed in ./INSTALL.
