[The original README has moved to doc/INTERNALS.]

Xpost3 is undergoing rapid changes in the direction of portability
under the skillful care of contributor Vincent Torri.

Currently the intepreter source is in src/bin and the commands
  ./autogen.sh (or ./configure if autogen.sh has already been launched)
  make
will create the interpreter binary itp(.exe)? in src/bin.
All data paths are currently relative to this directory.
So you have to cd src/bin to run it.
