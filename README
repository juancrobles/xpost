Xpost is undergoing rapid changes in the direction of portability
under the skillful care and guidance of contributor Vincent Torri.

Xpost is currently (10/15/2013, and in the author's opinion) a
pretty-solid cross-platform scripting-language interpreter.

Xpost has rudimentary graphics support. MS Windows or X11 windows.
PGM or PPM file output. Or a nulldevice, which executes the drawing
operations and discards the output. A BGR device is in development
which will yield the image data to a calling program which uses
xpost as a library component.

Quick Installation Instructions.
----- ------------ -------------

Currently the intepreter source is in src/bin and the commands
  ./autogen.sh (or ./configure if autogen.sh has already been launched)
  make
will create the interpreter binary xpost(.exe)? in src/bin.
  make install
will install the application, so itp can be run as a command.



Many more installation and configuration options desribed in ./INSTALL.
