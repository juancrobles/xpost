[The original README has moved to doc/INTERNALS.]

Xpost3 is undergoing rapid changes in the direction of portability
under the skillful care and guidance of contributor Vincent Torri.

Xpost3 is currently (10/15/2013, and in the author's opinion) a
pretty-solid cross-platform scripting-language interpreter.

But it does not currently have any graphical output capability. :(
        We're working on it. :)


Quick Installation Instructions.
----- ------------ -------------

Currently the intepreter source is in src/bin and the commands
  ./autogen.sh (or ./configure if autogen.sh has already been launched)
  make
will create the interpreter binary itp(.exe)? in src/bin.
  make install
will install the application, so itp can be run as a command.



Many more installation and configuration options desribed in ./INSTALL.
