   These error codes are (mostly) defined in the PLRM and can be returned by operator 
   functions and handled at the postscript level. If an operator (including a device
   function) returns a value outside of this range, the error-name returned to postscript
   will be /unknownerror. In some circumstances, /unregistered is used also used for this
   purpose, since it has no documented use in the PLRM.

   An operator function may fail to execute if the operator_exec function cannot match
   the type signature against the operand stack. It will then return a /typecheck or
   /stackunderflow error to postscript.

   contextswitch and ioblock represent requests to the interpreter to change the state
   of the execution-context. They cannot be caught by postscript error code.
